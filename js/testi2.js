quotes[0]="<p>TomasinoWeb, for me is a very dynamic organization, yet with a simple goal, which is for Thomasians to get connected with information and reliable news they need during their stay in the University. Likewise, it also prepares its members to be professional after they graduate from UST. TomasinoWeb helped me learn how to go out of my comfort zone and experience an amazing college life.</p><footer>Jastyn Limon (Batch 5), Executive Secretary</footer>"

quotes[1]="<p>Tomasinoweb will always be my second family in UST.

quotes[2]="<p>TomWeb yung nagbigay kulay sa buhay kulehiyo ko. Kahit malayo ako sa pamilya ko hindi ko naramdaman na wala akong makakapitan habang nasa UST ako, dahil dito ako natuto maging isang mabuting estudyante, student leader, at tao. Wala siguro ako sa posisyon ko ngayon sa kumpanya kung hindi dahil sa TomWeb.</p><footer>Kit Valmadrid (Batch 1), External Vice President (2008-2009)</footer>"
