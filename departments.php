			Update. Inform. Share. All these and more are what the Writing Department of TomasinoWeb does. Being so, it is the task of the department to see topics of relevance for Thomasians--be it news or features, sports or stories--and make write-ups for our audience to be in the know.

			<h3 style="color: #25a4de;">Photography Department</h3>
			Snap. Capture. Shot. Expect these in a typical photography team. But in TomasinoWeb's Photography Department, those three are just part of the things we can offer. We not only relay stunning photos for the Thomasian community to cherish, but the department also provides a learning ground for improvement.
