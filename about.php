            <p class="text-right">TomasinoWeb was founded in 2007 by student volunteers mainly from the Faculty of Arts and Letters and Faculty of Engineering under the guidance of the Santo Tomas e-service Providers (STePS). It was the former STePS Director, Rev. Fr. Melchor Saria, who conceptualized the TomasinoWeb. In 2008, it has been recognized as a university-wide organization and online student publication of UST.</p>
